        <h4>Raghuvaran</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">When Raghuvaran first started approached Srujan Jayraj for a body transformation, he was hardly eating two meals a day and was running ten kilometers every day! Despite this, he was unable to burn fat. He had already attempted training at various gyms across Mumbai and Hyderabad. However, most of the trainers he had approached insisted on a unhealthy cocktail of fat burners, pre workout drinks and so on, which affected him badly, even resulting in him experiencing anxiety attacks. All this and yet, no results. When Badar Alam finally approached to Srujan Jayraj, he had made it very clear that he was not ready to take any supplements, even not as much as a multi-vitamin. Srujan Jayraj crafted an approach for him that excluded any and all supplements, even asking him to quit coffee. Unbelievably, four months later, Badar was able to achieve the physique he wanted. Encouraged by the positive results, he continues to train at Steel and not just that, his inspiration has led to his three brothers joining at Steel as well!</p>

        <h4>Aravind</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">Aravind is a businessman who had come to Hyderabad to setup a factory. During his trip, he had gotten to witness Srujan Jayraj training his clients. Impressed by the skill and finesse with which Srujan Jayraj trained, Aravindh was keen to train with him as well. However, Aravindh only had three months to accomplish his goal. In addition, Aravindh is a vegetarian, which made the task even more challenging. However, protein shakes proved vastly helpful to work around his situation. Aravindhâ€™s own dedication was a huge factor, as well. Infact, when he had to travel to Singapore on a business assignment, he was committed to his diet, by only consuming protein shakes for 7 days straight! Of course, this is not recommended for everyone, but Aravindh had to work around his dietary restrictions to ensure that he was getting his required protein. Aravindh now stays in Mumbai and still swears by Srujan Jayrajâ€™s training methods and advice.</p>

        <h4>Kranthi</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">Kranthi is a competitive bodybuilder. He was first introduced to Srujan Jayraj to buy supplements. When Srujan Jayraj was training Rana Daggubati for an outdoor shoot in Italy, Kranthi had called Srujan Jayraj. He had gotten selected for Musclemania, a high profile bodybuilding event held at Las Vegas. He wanted Srujan Jayraj to help him get ripped and stage ready in three months. The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. The pictures above clearly show how well the Srujan Jayrajâ€™s transformation plan worked for Kranthi, despite being such a short term program. Kranthi won first in his division, which gave him tremendous recognition in Hyderabad. Thereafter, he was able to start his own successful personal training business. Infact, he currently trains actor Prabhas, a famous Tollywood actor. At Steel, we believe in more than just getting you a great body. We help you gain all the knowledge and expertise required in training your body yourself!</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Sagar approached Srujan Jayraj with a dream of attaining a six pack body one day. His dream transformed into reality in just 5 months!Sagar is a vegetarian, except that he consumes eggs in his diet. Despite the limitations in the diet, he was able to see results quite soon.Disclaimer: I donâ€™t typically recommend an egg only diet, however, each client has their own unique dietary preferences or lifestyle choices, that make it imperative for me to work around them.</p>
